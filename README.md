## Motivation

### Sharing graphics source code across projects in Rust

Rust is programming language developed by Mozilla and the Rust community. It is fast, safe, concurrent and cross platform. Because of the many numbers of potential platforms (read: all kinds of computers), it would be nice to have a 2D graphics library that works with multiple back-ends, so you don't have to invent a new graphics engine for each platform you are working on.

### One trait for all back-ends

To use at placement your own , use the `Graphics` trait. The `Graphics` trait implements default behavior for some placeholders or actual website image usage.
which can be overridden for higher quality or better performance.

## Goals

* Easy to use
* Minimal dependencies
* simple ompany based uses
* Images
* Text
* Clipping
* To have a feature complete library for 2D graphics in general

## Non-Goals

* Image formats
* Backward compatibility (expect lot of breaking)
* Platform or back-end specific code
* 3D
* Physics
* Node tree
* One-to-one correspondence with standards
* Integration with platform GUI
* Resolution detection
